# Note: Description of buttons is in Gun4IR terminology
# Gun4IR is a DIY project with different target gun-housings which means that
# the number of available buttons and the layout WILL vary depending on target housing.
# This template will give you all supported buttons but changes might be necessary to fit your personal button layout.
#
# ATTENSION: On Pi/Linux the Gun4IR fimware will configure a USB composite device (gamepad/mouse/keyboard.. all at once) so that
# it might be necessary to disable the generic-mouse device in order to NOT have the devices be configured as multiple player's input devices.
